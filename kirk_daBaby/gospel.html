    Gospel
    </h1>
    <p>
      This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey (Nipsey, yeah)
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty (empty, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And the day I die, I bet lil' Jon goin' down in history
'Cause I've been solo, ridin' dolo, I've been stuntin'
No, hoe, it's a no-go, I don't want you (yeah)
And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long
I came from nothin'
