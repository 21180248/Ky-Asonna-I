    </p>My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (uh, brr)
Said if I leave her,  she gon' die
Well,  bitch, you done with life (okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (alright)
What I look like with all them twenties? (huh?)
Know them hoes like how I'm coming (yeah)
What I look like with all this money? (huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (uh)
When I crack a smile, white gold (bling)
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze (yeah)
Came from the bottom, toes (woah, Kenny)
