    <p>Everybody know my name ringin' bells
Ringin' bells like the hallway (uh-huh)
I ain't gotta cap in no mothafuckin' rap
I'll whip out and air it out broad day (mmm)
I got in with that stick, and I'm with that
Break a nigga in half like a Kit-Kat (uh-huh)
I been tryna be positive, mama (uh-huh)
They ain't fuckin' wit' Jonathan, mama (nope)
Who you know put they mothafuckin' self on the map
And now they don't owe nobody shit? (me)
I send one of my lil' niggas, come take you off
You get laid on the floor by a jit (ha)
Got pulled over with fifty-five K in my pocket (woo)
The police, they know I'm legit (woo, woo)
The police, they know I got sticks
They be worried about me, they know I'm a clique
These niggas, they know I'm a dawg
